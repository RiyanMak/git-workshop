# Best Practices

Product Development is a team sport. Cordination and communitcation is the key to success.

# Main vs. Dev Branch

The main branch is exclusively reserved for production ready code. Everything on main should be treated as if it already is in the hands of the consumer.

## Redunencies - Protecting the Main Branch

Before anything is merged into main, it should be reviewed and tested by at least one other person depending on the size and complexity of the project.
