# Before We Start 
    - WINDOWS USERS: Please consider installing Linux based Command Prompt such as powershell, MinGW, or Cygwin. It is highly highly recommended. 

    - You'll need to use the command prompt for almost all of these procedures (<link to command prompt tutorial and cheat sheet>). 
    You should get used to it because you'll see/use it sooner or later. 

# 2. Git 
Git is a version control software. There are other version control systems, we use Git in this tutorial. 

To install, please follow instructions from the official website: 
 https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git 

# 3. GitHub 
GitHub is a code repository. There are other code repositories such as Bitbucket and GitLab. Feel free to explore others, but we use GitHub in this tutorial. 

Ok, now create a GitHub account:
